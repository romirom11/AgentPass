# AgentPass — User Stories

## Personas

### Owner (Human/Organization)
A developer or company that creates and manages AI agents. Needs to give agents autonomous identity while maintaining control and visibility.

### Agent (AI)
An autonomous AI agent (Claude Code, CrewAI, AutoGPT, etc.) that needs to authenticate on internet services to complete tasks.

### Service (Third-party)
A website or API that wants to support agent authentication, either natively (via SDK) or passively (agents register like humans).

### US-1.4: Configure Agent Permissions
**As an** owner,

## Epic 2: Fallback Authentication

### US-2.1: Register on a New Service
**As an** agent,
**I want to** register on a website using my passport email and a generated password,
**So that** I can access the service autonomously.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agent calls `register(url)` via MCP

- Finds email/password form (skips OAuth buttons)
- Fills with passport email + secure generated password
- Handles email verification automatically
- Saves credentials to vault

### US-2.2: Login to an Existing Service
**As an** agent,
**I want to** login to a service where I already have credentials,
**So that** I can resume work without re-registering.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agent calls `authenticate(url)` via MCP
- System checks credential vault
- If credentials exist, attempts login
- If session valid, returns immediately
- If expired, re-login with stored credentials
- Total time: ~5 seconds for repeat login

### US-2.3: Handle Email Verification
**As an** agent,
**I want to** automatically handle email verification during registration,
**So that** I can complete signup without human intervention.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Wait for verification email (timeout: 60s)
- Extract verification link from email body
- Navigate to link in browser
- Confirm verification success
- If email doesn't arrive, escalate to owner

### US-2.4: Handle CAPTCHA Escalation
**As an** agent,
**I want to** escalate CAPTCHAs to my owner,
**So that** registration can proceed despite anti-bot measures.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Detect CAPTCHA on page (reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, Turnstile)
- Take screenshot of current page
- Send notification to owner via webhook
- Owner can view live browser session
- Owner solves CAPTCHA
- Agent detects CAPTCHA resolved and continues
- If owner doesn't respond within timeout, skip and notify

### US-2.5: Session Management
**As an** agent,
**I want to** have my sessions automatically refreshed,
**So that** I don't need to re-authenticate manually.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Try stored cookies/token first
- If expired (401/403), re-login with stored credentials
- If credentials invalid, notify owner
- No infinite retries — max 2 attempts then escalate

- If supported, use native flow: send passport + signature
- Service verifies via AgentPass API
- Receive session token
- Total time: ~500ms

### US-3.2: Integrate AgentPass SDK
